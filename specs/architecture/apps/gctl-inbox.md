# Application: gctrl-inbox (Human Action Center)

gctrl-inbox is a **native application** — the structured I/O channel between agents and humans. It aggregates requests, alerts, and notifications into context-grouped threads, enabling humans to triage and batch-act on agent needs without per-message context switching.

Unix analogy: `/dev/tty` + `mail` + signal handling. Agents are processes that occasionally need human input (`read(stdin)`), guardrails emit signals (`SIGSTOP`), and the inbox is the terminal where the operator responds.

## Architectural Position

gctrl-inbox is a **native application** in the Unix layer model, peer to gctrl-board.

```
App (gctrl-inbox) → Shell (HTTP API :4318) → Kernel (Storage, Guardrails, Orchestrator)
```

- **Depends on the shell** — reads/writes data via kernel HTTP API (`:4318`). MUST NOT access DuckDB directly or import kernel crates.
- **Never depended on by the shell or kernel** — removing the app breaks nothing below it.
- **Storage tables registered on kernel** — `inbox_*` DuckDB tables are registered in the kernel's `schema.rs` and `all_migrations()`, same pattern as `board_*` tables. HTTP routes (`/api/inbox/*`) are registered on the kernel's axum router at `:4318`. This follows the established gctrl-board pattern where the kernel hosts app storage and API routes while apps provide the domain logic via shell commands and web UIs.
- **Web UI served separately** — the inbox web UI (feed, thread views, batch action bar) is served by its own HTTP server on a separate port, distinct from the kernel `:4318` API.
- **Has a CLI surface** — `gctrl inbox` commands live in the shell package and call kernel HTTP endpoints directly.
- **Companion to gctrl-board** — inbox handles time-sensitive requests ("what needs my attention now"); board handles strategic planning ("what's the plan"). They share issue context but are independently optional.

## Scope

### Owns

1. **Message lifecycle** — creation, delivery, status transitions (`pending → acted/dismissed/snoozed/expired`)
2. **Thread auto-grouping** — grouping messages by issue key, session, project, or agent context
3. **Action recording** — structured human decisions (approve, deny, defer, delegate, reply) with audit trail
4. **Subscription management** — per-user control over what enters the inbox
5. **Batch actions** — atomic multi-message operations
6. **Board integration** — pending count badges on issues, cross-linked threads, bidirectional events

### Does NOT Own

1. **Guardrail policies** — kernel guardrail engine decides when to block; inbox only receives the notification
2. **Agent dispatch/resume** — orchestrator manages agent lifecycle; inbox emits `PermissionGranted`/`PermissionDenied` events via kernel IPC
3. **External notifications** — drivers (GitHub, Linear) produce events; inbox receives and groups them
4. **Issue lifecycle** — board/tracker owns issue status transitions; inbox actions may trigger board events but don't directly mutate issue state
5. **Notification delivery** — inbox does not push to email, SMS, Slack. External delivery is a driver concern.

## Message Sources

| Source | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `kernel` | Orchestrator lifecycle events | Session started/completed/failed, task retry |
| `guardrail` | Policy enforcement events | Permission blocked, budget warning, budget exceeded |
| `agent` | Agent-initiated messages | Clarification requests, questions |
| `board` | Board-originated requests | Review requests, eval requests |
| `driver-github` | GitHub events via kernel driver | PR review requested, CI failed, issue comment |
| `driver-linear` | Linear events via kernel driver | [deferred] |

## Message Kinds

| Kind | Requires Action | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `permission_request` | Yes | Agent needs approval for gated operation |
| `budget_warning` | No | Cost threshold approaching |
| `budget_exceeded` | Yes | Cost limit reached, agent blocked |
| `agent_question` | Yes | Agent needs clarification |
| `clarification` | Yes | Ambiguous spec or acceptance criteria |
| `review_request` | Yes | PR or work ready for human review |
| `eval_request` | Yes | Work completed, needs eval scoring |
| `status_update` | No | Informational: session completed, issue moved |
| `custom` | Varies | Driver or user-defined messages |

## Interaction with Board

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Board["gctrl-board"]
        Issue["BACK-42<br/>Fix auth middleware"]
        Badge["⚡ 3 pending"]
    end

    subgraph Inbox["gctrl-inbox"]
        Thread["Thread: BACK-42"]
        M1["🔒 Permission: force-push"]
        M2["💰 Budget at 80%"]
        M3["❓ Agent question"]
    end

    Thread --> Issue
    Issue --> Badge
    M1 --> Thread
    M2 --> Thread
    M3 --> Thread
```

All cross-app data flows through **kernel IPC events**. gctrl-inbox and gctrl-board MUST NOT call each other's APIs directly or join each other's tables.

- **Issue cards show inbox badge** — board fetches pending count via kernel API (`GET /api/inbox/threads?context_type=issue&context_ref={key}`)
- **Inbox threads link to issues** — inbox enriches display by fetching issue metadata via kernel API (`GET /api/board/issues/{key}`)
- **Actions emit kernel events** — approving a permission emits `PermissionGranted` via kernel IPC; board subscribes and creates a board event
- **Board emits events** — `ReviewRequested`, `IssueClosed`, `IssueAssigned`, `IssueUnblocked` flow through kernel IPC; inbox subscribes and creates/archives threads
- **Assignment creates subscription** — board emits `IssueAssigned`; inbox subscribes and auto-creates a subscription for the user

## Kernel Integration

### M0 Bootstrap (No IPC — Direct HTTP Routes)

Kernel IPC (event bus) is [planned] but not yet implemented. For M0, gctrl-inbox follows the same integration pattern as gctrl-board:

1. **Storage tables** (`inbox_*`) are registered in the kernel's `schema.rs` and created by `all_migrations()`
2. **HTTP routes** (`/api/inbox/*`) are registered on the kernel's axum router at `:4318`
3. **Handlers** in the kernel call `DuckDbStore` methods for inbox CRUD
4. **Shell commands** (`gctrl inbox`) call kernel HTTP API via `KernelClient`
5. **Message creation** is triggered by shell commands or kernel-side handlers — not by an event subscription model

This means for M0, the guardrail→inbox flow is:
- Guardrail handler in receiver.rs checks `POST /v1/traces` spans
- When a guardrail denies with human-review flag, the handler directly calls `store.create_inbox_message()`
- This is a kernel-internal call (same process), not a cross-app event

### Future: Event-Driven Model

When kernel IPC (event bus) lands, the integration migrates to event subscriptions:

**Inbound (Kernel Events → Inbox Subscribes):**
1. `GuardrailDenied` → inbox creates `permission_request` message
2. `BudgetThreshold` / `BudgetExceeded` → inbox creates `budget_warning` or `budget_exceeded` message
3. `SessionPaused` with reason `needs_input` → inbox creates `agent_question` message

**Outbound (Inbox Emits → Kernel Events):**
1. `PermissionGranted` → orchestrator resumes session
2. `PermissionDenied` → orchestrator terminates/adjusts session
3. `ClarificationProvided` → agent context updated

## Runtime

- **Application logic:** Effect-TS (same stack as gctrl-board)
- **Web UI:** React 19 + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (shared component library with gctrl-board)
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)

## Storage

Four DuckDB tables with `inbox_` prefix (per Invariant #3):

| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `inbox_messages` | Individual notifications/requests | `id`, `thread_id`, `source`, `kind`, `urgency`, `status`, `requires_action`, `context` (JSON) |
| `inbox_threads` | Context-grouped conversations | `id`, `context_type`, `context_ref`, `project_key`, `pending_count`, `latest_urgency` |
| `inbox_actions` | Human decision audit trail | `id`, `message_id`, `actor_id`, `action_type`, `reason` |
| `inbox_subscriptions` | Per-user notification filters | `id`, `user_id`, `filter_type`, `filter_value`, `enabled` |

Indexes on: thread_id, status, urgency, kind (messages); context_type+context_ref, project_key (threads); message_id, actor_id (actions); user_id (subscriptions).

## Surfaces

| Surface | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Web UI: Inbox Feed** | Threads sorted by urgency, filter sidebar, batch action bar. Served by gctrl-inbox's own HTTP server. |
| **Web UI: Thread View** | Chronological messages with inline action buttons, context panel (linked issue, session, cost). |
| **Web UI: Board Widget** | Inbox panel embedded in gctrl-board's issue detail page (pending messages for that issue). |
| **Shell CLI** | `gctrl inbox` subcommands for list, view, approve, deny, batch-approve, actions, stats, subscriptions. |
| **Shell HTTP** | `/api/inbox/*` routes in the kernel — data API consumed by web UI and CLI. |
| **SSE** | `/api/inbox/sse` for real-time updates to web UI (no polling). |
